# About Me
## About My Research
I am a Master 1st student on Japan. My research theme is the development of applications that use machine learning. After graduate school, I would like to work in the field of machine learning and data analysis.
In college, I learned about a wide range of fields such as classical control theory, information theory, and optical engineering.
I have a part-time job at a company creating applications using Laravel. 

## About Mchine Learning
I mainly use scikit-learn to do supervised machine learning. I have not yet done any deep learning. Therefore, I would like to learn more about deep learning in the future.
